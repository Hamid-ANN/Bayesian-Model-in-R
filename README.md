# Bayesian-Model-in-R
Bayesian models combine prior insights with insights from observed data to form updated, posterior insights about a parameter.
Bayesian approach are very flexible, produces clear and direct inferences, and  makes use of all available information.


Advantages:

1.Applicable with a smaller data points 

2.Usage of prior intuitions (from pre-existing observations/models)  on the  posterior resluts 

3.Having high levels of uncertainty, or a strong need to quantify the level of uncertainty about a particular model or comparison of models

4.Wanting to claim something about the likelihood of the alternative hypothesis, rather than simply accepting/rejecting the null hypothesis



Disadvantages:

1.Lack of enough experience on the application of Bayesian models on the 'big data' applications 


2.Sampling posterior distributions in Bayesian models is computationally expensive and slow .

Computational details:
In this example I have used JAGS package. It stands for Just Another Gibbs Sampler. It is a program for analysis of Bayesian hierarchical models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation.
